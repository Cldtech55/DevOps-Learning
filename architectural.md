#3 tier architecture

Presentation Tier (UI): The face of the application, where users interact through web interfaces or mobile apps. Think of it as the grand entrance to the palace, welcoming and engaging visitors. Technologies like React, Angular, and Swift work their magic here.
Application Tier (Logic): The brains of the operation, responsible for processing data, managing business logic, and orchestrating communication between tiers. It's the hidden courtyard, where the palace guard diligently oversees operations and ensures smooth flow. Java, Python, and Node.js are frequent residents of this tier.
Data Tier (Storage): The treasure vault housing all the application's data. Databases, like MySQL, MongoDB, or even cloud storage solutions, play the role of the secure chambers, safeguarding precious information.
